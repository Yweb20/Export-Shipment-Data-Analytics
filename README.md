Export Shipment Data Analytics

Overview 📊

This project is a real-world data engineering and analytics assignment designed to analyze export shipment data and generate actionable insights. It demonstrates data extraction, cleaning, transformation, visualization, and reporting skills using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Selenium. The project showcases the end-to-end process from raw data to dashboards, simulating a professional workflow.

---

Dataset 📁

The project uses a shipment dataset containing export shipment details, compliance status, GST, EGM, ports, and other operational data.

Files include:
Cleaned_Final_Shipments.csv – cleaned and processed dataset

Summary folder – containing port summary, status summary, GST summary

Selenium_extracted_data.csv – data extracted via Selenium from the source web portal

Note: The Selenium-extracted CSV is separate for clarity; the code is embedded in the Jupyter notebook.

Tools and Technologies 🛠️

Python – data processing and automation

Selenium – web data extraction

Pandas & NumPy – data cleaning and transformation

SQL (MySQL) – database creation, normalization, and queries

Power BI – interactive dashboard and visualizations

Docker – containerized execution of Python scripts

Project Steps 📝

1. Data Extraction
Selenium automation script in data_processing.ipynb fetches shipment data from the web portal.
Extracted data is saved as selenium_extracted_data.csv.

3. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Raw data cleaned using Pandas in Jupyter notebook.
Generated additional columns like:
GST_Compliance_Status (Compliant / Non-Compliant)
Shipment_Type (Incentive / Non-Incentive)
Port_Code, SB_Year, Status_Priority

5. SQL Database Creation
Normalized data into three tables: Shipment_Info, Exporter_Compliance, EGM_Info.
Defined primary and foreign keys to maintain relational integrity.
Performed queries to summarize shipments by port, GST compliance, and EGM availability.

6. Excel Analysis
Pivot tables created for:
Shipment counts by type, port, and year
GST compliance and EGM availability
Excel formulas automated calculation of compliance, priority, and other metrics.

7. Power BI Dashboard
Visualizations created include:
Donut charts (GST Compliance, EGM Availability)
Clustered column charts (Shipments by Type and Port)
KPI cards for total shipments, compliant shipments, and EGM available
Slicers for PORT, IEC, Status, Gateway, EGM
Dashboard presents an overview of operational metrics and insights.

Key Results and Insights 📈


Total Shipments: 379

GST Compliant Shipments: 100% (as per dataset)

EGM Availability: 100% (as per dataset)

Shipment Distribution: Identified top ports and shipment types

Operational Summary: Real-time overview of export compliance and logistics efficiency

How to Run the Project ⚡

1. Using Docker
Build the Docker image:
Copy code
Bash
docker build -t data-processor .
Run the container:
Copy code
Bash
docker run --rm -v "%cd%":/app data-processor
Output files (e.g., processed_output.csv) will be generated in your local folder.

3. Using Jupyter Notebook
Open data_processing.ipynb in Jupyter Lab or Notebook.
Execute cells sequentially to:
Load and clean datasets
Perform transformations
Save processed CSV files

5. Power BI Dashboard
Open PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix file.
Refresh data if needed, interact with slicers, and explore visual insights.

Selenium Section 🕸️

Selenium automation code is included inside the data_processing.ipynb notebook.
It extracts shipment data from the source web portal and saves it as selenium_extracted/extracted_shipments.csv.
This ensures the process and output are reproducible.
